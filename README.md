# Djutor ðŸ©º

**Djutor** is a full-featured private clinic management system designed to streamline the entire clinical workflow, from appointment booking and medical examination to prescription, billing, and revenue reporting.

The system follows a client-server architecture built with **Django Rest Framework** (backend) and **React** (frontend), **React Native** (mobile), and implements **OAuth2** for secure role-based authentication and authorization.

There are four main user roles in the system: **Administrator**, **Doctor**, **Nurse**, and **Patient**, each with specific permissions and responsibilities:

-   **"Patients can register an account (with avatar), book or cancel appointments, and receive confirmation emails after their appointments are approved by nurses."**

-   **"Nurses manage appointment schedules, confirm bookings, and handle billing tasks."**

-   **"Doctors are responsible for accessing patient medical records, diagnosing, prescribing medicine, and managing prescription histories."**

-   **"Administrators have full control over system data, including managing doctors, nurses, medicines, work schedules, and generating dynamic reports with charts for patient visits and revenue analysis."**

The system also includes advanced features such as:

-   **"Email notifications for appointment confirmations"**

-   **"Integration with Momo or ZaloPay e-wallets for online payments"**

-   **"Optional Google/Facebook social login for user convenience"**

**Djutor** aims to digitize and optimize clinic operations, minimize manual workloads, and improve service transparency, accuracy, and efficiency for both medical staff and patients.
